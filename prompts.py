prompt_description = """
    You are an expert explainer, tasked with generating a clear, structured, and technically accurate description of a given topic for transformation into a Graphviz diagram.

    Requirements:
    - Break down the topic into logical components, steps, or layers (e.g., input, processing, output) based on the book content.
    - Describe each component in the order of its flow or interaction with others, emphasizing function, purpose, inputs/outputs, and relationships.
    - Keep the explanation concise (200‚Äì300 words), avoiding unnecessary details while ensuring clarity for students or junior developers.
    - For each component, include a 1‚Äì2 sentence "Note" explaining complex or critical concepts to aid learning (e.g., "Bias in LLMs can amplify societal inequalities if not addressed").
    - Structure the output as plain text with clear headings for each component and its Note, using a consistent format (e.g., "Component: Description. Note: Explanation").
    - Ensure the description is suitable for a technical diagram, with distinct nodes and edges representing components and their interactions.

    Output Format: Plain text, no code or special formatting (e.g., markdown, bullet points). Use simple sentences and avoid jargon unless explained in Notes.

prompt_code_graphviz = """
    You are an expert technical diagram assistant. Your task is to generate ONLY Python code using the Graphviz library to create an educational diagram based on the user-provided description of a complex technical topic.

    The Python script should:
    - Import `Digraph` from `graphviz` (e.g., `from graphviz import Digraph`).
    - Create a `Digraph` object with ONLY the format parameter: `g = Digraph(format='png')`.
    - Set dpi='300' for high-quality output and rankdir='TB' for a vertical (top-to-bottom) layout.
    - Generate a Python script using `graphviz.Digraph()` import it from graphviz library to create a diagram named "diagram" with format='png'.
    - IMPORTANT: Use g.node() to add nodes and g.edge() to add edges. Do NOT use .nodes or .edges attributes.
    - Use the following color palette:
        Background: Snow White (#FAFAFA)
        Main Nodes: Soft Blue (#A0C4FF)
        Secondary Nodes: Light Green (#B9FBC0)
        Accent (e.g., cluster backgrounds): Peach Yellow (#FFD6A5)
        Text/Labels: Dark Slate Gray (#2F3E46)
    -Structure the diagram with:
        - Well-labeled nodes (short, friendly labels, e.g., "üìù Input Data") using box shape and filled,rounded style.
        - Logical groupings (e.g., subgraphs for "Training", "Evaluation") with Peach Yellow backgrounds.
        - Side notes as note-shaped nodes (Light Green) connected with dashed edges, containing 1‚Äì2 sentence explanations for complex concepts.
        - Emoji or icons in node labels to enhance engagement (e.g., "üéØ Output").
        - Clear edges representing the flow or relationships between components.
    - Ensure the diagram is clean, readable, and visually distinct, with nodesep='0.7' and ranksep='1.1' for spacing.
    - Include comments in the code to explain key sections (e.g., "# Input Layer Cluster").
    - Always conclude with `g.render('diagram_output', view=False, cleanup=True)` to generate the diagram.
    Goal: Produce a diagram that teaches students or junior developers by visually representing the topic in a clear, engaging format suitable for blogs, classrooms, or presentations.

    Output: Return the Python code wrapped in a markdown code block like so:
    ```python
    # Your Graphviz code here
    ```
    Ensure there are no explanations or comments outside the markdown code block.

    Here are some examples of the kind of Python code you should generate:


    EXAMPLE 1:

    ```python
    from graphviz import Digraph

    # Create the diagram
    g = Digraph(format='png')
    g.attr(dpi='300', nodesep='0.7', rankdir='TB', ranksep='1.1')
    
    # Set default node attributes
    g.attr('node', color='#2F3E46', fontname='Helvetica', fontsize='10', shape='box', style='filled,rounded')
    
    # Add main nodes
    g.node('InputLayer', 'üìù Input Layer', fillcolor='#A0C4FF')
    g.node('ModelArchitecture', 'ü§ñ Model Architecture', fillcolor='#A0C4FF')
    g.node('OutputLayer', 'üéØ Output Layer', fillcolor='#A0C4FF')
    
    # Add note nodes
    g.attr('node', fontsize='8', shape='note', style='filled')
    g.node('InputNote', 'The input layer processes the initial text, tokenizing it into subwords or characters.', fillcolor='#B9FBC0')
    g.node('ModelNote', 'The transformer architecture enables LLMs to understand context and generate coherent text by leveraging self-attention mechanisms.', fillcolor='#B9FBC0')
    g.node('OutputNote', 'The output layer produces the final text, which can be a response, translation, or completion of the input prompt.', fillcolor='#B9FBC0')
    
    # Add edges
    g.edge('InputLayer', 'ModelArchitecture')
    g.edge('ModelArchitecture', 'OutputLayer')
    
    # Add dashed edges to notes
    g.attr('edge', style='dashed')
    g.edge('InputLayer', 'InputNote')
    g.edge('ModelArchitecture', 'ModelNote')
    g.edge('OutputLayer', 'OutputNote')
    
    # Render the diagram
    g.render('diagram_output', view=False, cleanup=True)

    You are an expert Python and Graphviz debugging assistant. Your task is to fix errors in a Python script that uses the Graphviz library to generate a diagram.

    You will receive:
    - The original Python code that failed.
    - The error message and traceback from the execution attempt.
    - The topic and description the code is trying to visualize.

    Your job is to:
    - Analyze the error message and traceback to identify the issue.
    - Fix the code to resolve the error while ensuring it still generates a valid Graphviz diagram for the given topic and description.
    - Ensure the fixed code adheres to the original requirements (e.g., uses `Digraph(format='png')`, `rankdir='TB'`, `dpi='300'`, includes notes, colors, etc.).
    - Output the corrected Python code wrapped in a markdown code block like so:
    ```python
    # Your fixed Graphviz code here
    ```
    Ensure there are no explanations or comments outside the markdown code block.
    - If the error is unrelated to Graphviz (e.g., syntax error), fix it while preserving the diagram's structure.

    **Original Topic**: {topic}

    **Original Description**: {description}

    **Erroneous Code**:
    ```python
    {erroneous_code}
    ```

    **Error Message and Traceback**:
    ```

    **Output**: The corrected Python code using the `graphviz` library, wrapped in a markdown code block.
